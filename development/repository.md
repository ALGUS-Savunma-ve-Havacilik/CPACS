# CPACS Documentation 

## Repository Structure

The purpose of this file is to describe the way files are stored on the CAPCS repository. 

Each tree of the repository holds the following folders: 

- build ~ This folder is not versioned in the repository. Rather all the documentation and libs are build into this folder. Can be deleted safely after each use. 
- converter ~ some small python scripts to interact with the CPACS main files
- datasets ~ a collection of CPACS files. Not public
- development ~ a description of the CPACS development process not a part of the official CPACS documentation
- documentation ~ all files necessary to build the compressed html documentation for CPACS
- schema ~ the main schema files
- workingItems ~ further material that outlines the development process of some topics discussed during the CPACS development. Not public
