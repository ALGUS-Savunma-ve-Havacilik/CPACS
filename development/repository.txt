Repository Structure
---------------------

The purpose of this file is to describe the way files are stored on the CAPCS repository. 

All files concerning the CPACS development are stored on the DLR's SVN repository. The repository can be accessed via: https://svn.dlr.de/CPACS. Daniel Böhnke is the maintainer. 

The repository is grouped into the following sections: 

- trunk ~ the current and main development path
- tags  ~ the folder for tagged versions, i.e. every new version of CPACS that is developed in the trunk shall be copied with the corresponding version number to the tags folder
- branches ~ the branch folder for parallel development. Please note, while this folder has been active for a lot of the development it is actually more reasonable to work in the trunk folder!

Each tree of the repository holds the following folders: 

- build ~ This folder is not versioned in the repository. Rather all the documentation and libs are build into this folder. Can be deleted safely after each use. 
- converter ~ some small python scripts to interact with the CPACS main files
- datasets ~ a collection of CPACS files. Not extensive
- development ~ a description of the CPACS development process not a part of the official CPACS documentation
- documentation ~ all files necessary to build the compressed html documentation for CPACS
- schema ~ the main schema files
- workingItems ~ further material that outlines the development process of some topics discussed during the CPACS development.
